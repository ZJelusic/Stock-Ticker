# Stock-Ticker - it's not much but it was my first project made without tutorials
Little program which shows any stock/crypto realtime yfinance data

It is tiny, slow and bad looking but it's my first project in Python (bear in mind that I was 2 months into learning Python at the time) and I made it without 'borrowing code' or "how to" google/youtube tutorials so I was kinda proud of it.

After adding few stock tickers it becomes slower and slower probably because its taking too much api data and also I haven't figured how to solve issue of overlapping labels -> after refreshing labels, old ones arent deleted but new ones are written above old ones.
