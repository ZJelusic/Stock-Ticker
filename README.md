# Stock-Ticker
Little program which shows realtime yfinance stock data

It is tiny, slow and bad looking but it's my first project in Python (bear in mind that at the time I was 2 months into learning Python) and I made it without 'borrowing code' or "how to" google/youtube tutorials so I was kinda proud of it at the time.
